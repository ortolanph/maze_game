# Skins Directory

Put the contents of a skin here. Each skin has its own directory.

## Skindoc

Use the `skindoc` util to document your skin before distributing.

Usage:

```shell
usage: skindoc [-h] [--skin SKIN]

Creates documentation for skins

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --skin SKIN  Skin JSON file
```

It will generate a `README.md` document inside the skin directory, containing an index to the assets used on the skins.
