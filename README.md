# Maze Game

A simple game written in Python using the PyGame API.

## NEWS

 - **2021-16-02**: First release

## Running

For now, it's only possible to see each room of the maze.

The maze is a 4 x 4 grid, so it's possible to issue the command:

```shell
python main.py <x> <y>
```

Where:
 * **x** can be between 0 and 3
 * **y** can be between 0 and 3

The starting room is at (0,1) and the ending room is at (3,3), and it's merely a coincidence.

## Installing Libs

Run the following command:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
